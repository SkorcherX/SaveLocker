## High priority

**All three bug bounties shipped in v0.5.0 (2026-07-29).** Code is on `main`; what remains is the
verification that did not happen before the tag. Write-ups:
`logs/2026-07-29_winagent-bugbounty.md`, `logs/2026-07-29_linuxagent-bugbounty.md`,
`logs/2026-07-27_console-bugbounty.md`.

- **v0.5.0 post-release verification.** Ordered by what carries the most risk of the release notes
  being wrong:
  - **Run `tests/linux/run-linux-tests.sh` in WSL** (40 checks). It holds the *only* tests for the
    Linux auto-start and `doctor` fixes, both of which shipped untested. Needs the ext4 clone.
  - **Deck verification** — the five scenarios in `logs/2026-07-29_linuxagent-bugbounty.md` →
    Verification. Hardware available since 2026-07-19.
  - **Second-Windows-account ACL test (WA-03).** The one with a user-visible consequence: the
    credentials are ACL-locked to the enrolling account and asserted against the well-known SIDs,
    but no second account has ever tried to read them, and it is unconfirmed that the enrolled user
    can still sync *and take a silent update* after a reboot. **v0.5.0's notes describe the change
    rather than promising the guarantee, and Known Issues says so — reword
    `web/src/releases/0.5.0.md` once this passes.** That file is both the console page and the
    GitHub Release body, so one edit fixes both.
  - Remaining Windows gates: fresh-VM install, a real game, a real non-Steam Steam shortcut, and the
    first-run Settings deep link on a cold WebView2 profile (the automated test drives the same code
    path through a refused launch, because the prompt is a modal dialog no test can answer).
  - **LAN enrollment-URL check** on the real deployment (`logs/2026-07-27_console-bugbounty.md` →
    Verification).

- **Back off when the server stays unreachable.** A Deck away from home retries forever at a fixed
  cadence: the offline drainer every 30 s (re-archiving the save folder each time before it finds
  out) *and* the command poller every 20 s, which also carries the heartbeat — roughly five failed
  requests a minute, indefinitely. Costs battery and metered traffic while travelling. Needs one
  shared backoff policy across all three loops, and a reset that does not make arriving home mean
  waiting out a 30-minute sleep. Bounded task, decisions to settle first, and the measurement that
  proves it: `tasks/OfflineBackoff.md`.

- **Missing regression tests from the Linux bounty — LA-04/05/06/07.** Folder-watcher refresh,
  multi-game add, the Game Mode window crash and the settings-write clobber all have code fixes and
  no tests. This is why several items above have to be checked by hand.

- **Self-host the console fonts.** The console loads Inter and JetBrains Mono from Google Fonts at
  runtime, so on a LAN box with no internet it renders in fallback fonts. CS-13 fixed the import
  being *discarded*, not the dependency. Needs woff2 subsets for five Inter weights; the Deck UI
  already vendors TTF Regular/SemiBold in `src/Agent.Linux/Ui/Fonts/` (SIL OFL).

- **Device-verify fresh Windows installer enrollment.** The wizard shipped in v0.1.7; the upgrade path is well verified. The **fresh install** (clean box, no `%PROGRAMDATA%\SaveLocker`) has never been exercised. Scenarios archived in `logs/2026-07-14_installer-enrollment.md`:
  - Happy path: run installer, choose enrollment file → page shows server + machine name → install → machine appears online in Machines.
  - ACL trap: `icacls "%PROGRAMDATA%\SaveLocker"` — interactive user needs Modify.
  - Expired-token, skip, and `/SILENT /ENROLL="C:\path\policy.json"`.

## Medium priority

- **Linux agent secret permissions and state layout.** `config.json` contains a long-lived machine key; file privacy depends on the launching shell's umask. Enforce `0700` on private state directories and `0600` on config, queue, health, and log files in code, including CLI enrollment paths. Consider separating immutable app files from mutable XDG config/state so upgrades cannot overlap the executable tree.

- **Linux auto-update.** The update channel (`/api/agent/latest`) is installer-shaped and Windows-only. A Deck user currently re-runs `install.sh` from a newer tarball. Worth doing before there are many Deck users — a headless device that never updates is one nobody will notice is stale.

- **Harden the `systemd --user` unit.** Add and Deck-test: `UMask=0077`, `NoNewPrivileges=yes`, `PrivateTmp=yes`, `ProtectSystem=full`, `RestrictAddressFamilies=AF_UNIX AF_INET AF_INET6`, `RestrictSUIDSGID=yes`, `LockPersonality=yes`. Mirror in both `packaging/linux/savelocker.service` and `SystemdAutoStart.UnitFile()`. Do **not** add `ProtectHome` (save access), `ProtectProc` (Linux writer probe), or `MemoryDenyWriteExecute` (.NET JIT). Record `systemd-analyze --user security savelocker.service` before/after on a Deck.

- **Linux release provenance.** Pin GitHub Actions in `release.yml` to full commit SHAs; publish SHA-256 checksums and a GitHub artifact attestation for the tarball; use draft → attach all assets → publish flow. Document the verification command beside the Deck install instructions.

- **Constrain external manifest paths.** The Ludusavi manifest is downloaded from mutable `master`; expanded templates are not proven to stay inside the intended Proton prefix. Pin or integrity-verify an approved manifest revision, canonicalize resolved paths, reject `..`/symlink escapes outside allowed roots, test a hostile manifest entry. Preserve explicit manually mapped portable-save paths as a separate trusted-user path.

- **Deferred: one state owner for the Linux agent** — wrapper→daemon IPC over a Unix socket, standalone fallback when no daemon is up. The locking in `Decisions.md` §8 makes the current two-owner model *correct*; IPC would make it *simple*. Worth doing before the state files grow further.

## Planned / future

- ~~**Linux add-game streamlining — Phase 3.**~~ **Done — shipped 2026-07-24** (PR #25 + artwork PR #26). Gamepad-native `savelocker ui` (SDL + Dear ImGui in the existing binary), verified on a real Deck through the full cold flow. Archived design + rejected alternatives in `logs/2026-07-24_linux-agent-streamline.md`; §2 amendment in `Decisions.md`.

- **Game Mode UI reflects a stale game list.** `savelocker ui` only *reads* local `config.json`; it never reconciles with the server (only the daemon does, every 20s — `CommandPoller.ReconcileGamesAsync`). So a game deleted in the console still shows in Game Mode until the daemon runs, and there is no in-UI way to untrack. Deferred 2026-07-24 (maintainer chose to keep Phase 3 lean). Fix when revisited: reconcile-on-launch (+ periodic) in `savelocker ui`, optionally a per-game "Stop tracking" that also deletes server-side so the daemon does not re-adopt it (`CommandPoller.cs:157`).

- **Registry-based saves** — the Ludusavi manifest has a `registry:` section; only `files:` paths are handled.
- **Multi-directory saves** — some games list multiple save paths. The sync engine tracks one `SaveDirectory` per game; multi-dir support needs a schema change.
- **File-count / newest-mtime delta in conflict UI** — would help disambiguate conflict options. The server does not store it; needs computing at upload time or deriving from the archive on demand. Not done; everything else in conflict Tier 1 is complete.
